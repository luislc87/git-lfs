// which it may schedule and parallelise in whatever way it chooses, clients of
// this interface will receive notifications of progress and completion asynchronously.

// provides support for upload and download, it should be instantiated twice,
// advertising support for each direction separately.

// itself; organising the wider process including calling the API to get URLs,
// handling progress reporting and retries is the job of the core TransferQueue.
// This is so that the orchestration remains core & standard but TransferAdapter
// can be changed to physically transfer to different hosts with less code.
